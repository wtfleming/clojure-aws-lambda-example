# clojure-aws-lambda-example
Example Clojure AWS Lambda function deployed to a Docker container with SAM.

This lambda function will be run once a minute and output "-handleRequest called!" to CloudWatch logs.

Ensure you have installed the AWS SAM CLI https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html

```sh
# Build the app
sam build

# Run it locally for testing
sam local invoke --event test/eventbridge-scheduled-event.json

# The first time you deploy run this command to generate a deploy configuration,
# an S3 bucket, and an ECR repository for the stack
sam deploy --guided

# Subsequent deploys can use this command
sam deploy

# Tail the logs in the cloud from CloudWatch
# Change the stack-name to what you used in the guided deploy
sam logs -n ClojureAwsLambdaExampleFunction --stack-name sam-app --tail

# Delete resources associated with the stack
sam delete --stack-name sam-app
```
